## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

During this project I was able to put into practice implementing the challenges layout by using CSS Grid and grid-areas to make the site responsive on all screen sizes. I was also able to practice using the useState hook in React and programming logic to validate the email entered in the input.

### Continued development

This was my first time using grid for the whole site layout as well as implementing grid-areas to help with the media queries. This was challenging at first as there were a lot of new I had not used before that did not always react in the ways I believed they would. I ended up scrapping the css and starting over three times as my first few implementations were messy and confusing. There is still a lot to learn about grid but I'm glad I stuck with it and was able to get a responsive layout that I was happy with.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Reading through this helped me better understand all of the grid properties and how they affected each other.
